He arrived with a set of mental images of Africa gleaned from television broadcasts of low-budget Jungle Jim movies in his Iowa childhood and a single viewing of the film version of Out of Africa. Also with some worries about tropical diseases, insects and large predators. But the vibrant reality of Kenya and its people took over the second he deplaned in Nairobi, and this diary records Bill Bryson's impresssions of his trip with his inimitable trademark style of wry observation and curious insight. From the wrenching poverty of the Kibera slum in Nairobi to the meticulously manicured grounds of the Karen Blixen house and the human fossil riches of the National Museum, Bryson registers the striking contrasts of a postcolonial society in transition. He visits the astoundingly vast Great Rift Valley; undergoes the rigors of a teeth-rattling train journey to Mombasa and a hair-whitening flight through a vicious storm; and visits the refugee camps and the agricultural and economic projects where dedicated CARE professionals wage noble and dogged war against poverty, dislocation and corruption.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Travel,Nonfiction,Cultural,Africa,Humor,Autobiography,Memoir,Eastern Africa,Kenya,Biography,Adventure,Biography,Autobiography,History",,,,767915062,9.78077E+12,English,2002,December 3rd 2002,55,8839,602,3.45,258,1020,3507,2555,1499

A full Rails application probably has less total code than the XML you'd need to configure the same application in other frameworks. With this book you'll learn how to use \ActiveRecord\ to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. You'll learn how to use the \Action Pack\ framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using built-in Javascript and Ajax support. There are extensive chapters on testing, deployment, and scaling. You'll see how easy it is to install Rails using your web server of choice such as Apache or lighttpd or using its own included web server. You'll be writing applications that work with your favorite database MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more in no time at all. You'll create a complete online store application in the extended tutorial section, so you'll see how a full Rails application is developed---iteratively and rapidly. Rails strives to honor the Pragmatic Programmer's \DRY Principle\ by avoiding the extra work of configuration files and code annotations. You can develop in real-time: make a change, and watch it work immediately. Forget XML. Everything in Rails, from templates to control flow to business logic, is written in Ruby, the language of choice for programmers who like to get the job done well and leave work ontime for a change. Rails is the framework of choice for the new generation of Web 2.0 developers. Agile Web Development with Rails is the book for that generation, written by Dave Thomas Pragmatic Programmer and author of Programming Ruby and David Heinemeier Hansson, who created Rails.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Computer Science,Programming,Nonfiction,Science,Technology,Computer Science,Technical,Reference,Computer Science,Computers,Computer Science,Software,Science,Computer Science,Internet,Web,Unfinished",,,,,9.78098E+12,English,July 15th 2005,July 28th 2005,558,2109,111,3.84,56,125,505,829,594

Told in large part through the eyes of American debutantes, the story portrays innocent, wide-eyed, almost ethereal girls who turn into socially conscious women with financial worries--unrecognizable even to themselves. The beginning sections quickly catch the listener's attention, with lush descriptions of rooms, clothes, and the heights of feminine beauty. We enter a world of intrigue: secrets, characters with past relationships that could prove fatal, and competition taken to its limits. Its literary value notwithstanding, this book might appeal to soap opera and romance fans. For more attentive listeners, it quickly becomes disconcerting as more and more characters with awkward British-sounding names are added.

Led by Yana Maddock and Sean Shongili, Petaybee’s protectors prevailed. But now Petaybee is changing in mysterious, unprecedented ways, and the return of off-world scientists threatens the amazing planet and its equally amazing inhabitants with new dangers.,CHANGELINGS,They are Ronan Born for Water Shongili and Murel Monster Slayer Shongili. Twin brother and sister. Children of Yana and Sean. Children of Petaybee. As such, theirs is a destiny deeply intertwined with the sentient planet that is their home. For Ronan and Murel are more than human. Like their father, each can transform into a seal and converse telepathically with the planet’s creatures–such as the friendly otter whose life they save one day from a pack of ravenous wolves.,But the twins’ bravery has unforeseen results when a visiting scientist witnesses their startling metamorphosis and becomes obsessed with their capture. To protect their children, Sean and Yana send them to stay with a powerful family friend on an orbiting space station. But no one realizes that Ronan and Murel hunger to discover the origins of their shape-shifting talent–and that their search for knowledge will place them squarely in the path of peril.,Meanwhile, Petaybee is changing–and much faster than an ordinary planet’s natural evolution. It appears that portions of the sea are heating up and a landmass is suddenly rising from the depths. To investigate the startling occurrence, Sean heads out to the open water in his seal form. But the newly unstable region holds untold mysteries–and the potential for disaster.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Science Fiction,Fantasy,Science Fiction Fantasy,Fiction,Young Adult,Space,Audiobook,Adult,Fantasy,Paranormal,Space,Space Opera",,,,593056124,9.78059E+12,English,2005,Sep-06,288,2356,87,3.78,52,203,664,732,705

Bilateral, sy,While John McPhee was working on his previous book,,, he happened to walk by the engineering building at the University of Wyoming, where words etched in limestone said: \Strive on--the control of Nature is won, not given.\ In the morning sunlight, that central phrase--\the control of nature\--seemed to sparkle with unintended ambiguity. Bilateral, symmetrical, it could with equal speed travel in opposite directions. For some years, he had been planning a book about places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature, about in the words of the book itself \any struggle against natural forces--heroic or venal, rash or well advised--when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, to take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods.\ His interest had first been sparked when he went into the Atchafalaya--the largest river swamp in North America--and had learned that virtually all of its waters were metered and rationed by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' project called Old River Control.,In the natural cycles of the Mississippi's deltaic plain, the time had come for the Mississippi to change course, to shift its mouth more than a hundred miles and go down the Atchafalaya, one of its distributary branches. The United States could not afford that--for New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and all the industries that lie between would be cut off from river commerce with the rest of the nation. At a place called Old River, the Corps therefore had built a great fortress--part dam, part valve--to restrain the flow of the Atchafalaya and compel the Mississippi to stay where it is.,In Iceland, in 1973, an island split open without warning and huge volumes of lava began moving in the direction of a harbor scarcely half a mile away. It was not only Iceland's premier fishing port accounting for a large percentage of Iceland's export economy but it was also the only harbor along the nation's southern coast. As the lava threatened to fill the harbor and wipe it out, a physicist named Thorbjorn Sigurgeirsson suggested a way to fight against the flowing red rock--initiating an all-out endeavor unique in human history. On the big island of Hawaii, one of the world's two must eruptive hot spots, people are not unmindful of the Icelandic example. McPhee went to Hawaii to talk with them and to walk beside the edges of a molten lake and incandescent rivers.,Some of the more expensive real estate in Los Angeles is up against mountains that are rising and disintegrating as rapidly as any in the world. After a complex coincidence of natural events, boulders will flow out of these mountains like fish eggs, mixed with mud, sand, and smaller rocks in a cascading mass known as debris flow. Plucking up trees and cars, bursting through doors and windows, filling up houses to their eaves, debris flows threaten the lives of people living in and near Los Angeles' famous canyons. At extraordinary expense the city has built a hundred and fifty stadium-like basins in a daring effort to catch the debris.,Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature. Most striking in his vivid depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those who would attempt to wrest control from her--stubborn, often ingenious, and always arresting characters.","Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Art,Biography,Business,Children's,Christian,Classics,Comics,Cookbooks,Ebooks,Fantasy,Fiction,Graphic Novels,Historical Fiction,History,Horror,Memoir,Music,Mystery,Nonfiction,Poetry,Psychology,Romance,Science,Science Fiction,Self Help,Sports,Thriller,Travel,Young Adult,Nonfiction,Science,Environment,Nature,History,Environment,Writing,Essays,Science,Geology,Science,Natural History,Science,Engineering,Science,Geography",John Burroughs Medal 1990,,,374522596,9.78037E+12,English,1989,September 1st 1990,288,3950,335,4.25,25,91,523,1526,1785

If, on the other hand, you are not much engaged by the spatial complexities of the science, you could miss a richness of human history that has its place among the strata described. Sometimes it is said of geologists that they reflect in their professional styles the sort of country in which they grew up. Nowhere could that be more true than in the life of a geologist born in the center of Wyoming and raised on an isolated ranch. This is the story of that ranch, soon after the turn of the century, and of the geologist who grew up there, at home with the composition of the high country in the way that someone growing up in a coastal harbor would be at home with the vagaries of the sea. While,is a portrayal of extraordinary people, it is also a history of the landscape around them, where, with remarkable rapidity, mountains came up out of the flat terrain. Gradually, the mountains were buried, until only the higher peaks remained above a vast plain.

Eventually Heidi comes to accept the fact that liberation can be achieved only if one is true to oneself, with goals that come out of need rather than circumstance.
